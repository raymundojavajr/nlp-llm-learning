    "### Assignment -->  Use Case 1: Removing subsequent occurrence of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Removing subsequent occurrences of words (also known as deduplication of adjacent duplicate words) is a common preprocessing step in NLP. This task is important because: \n",
    "1. Repeated words can distort text analysis, especially in tasks like text summarization, sentiment analysis, and language modeling.\n",
    "2. Removing redundant words improves the readability of the text, making it more coherent.\n",
    "3. Reducing noise in the text data can improve the performance of machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input:\n",
    "A single string text that may contain multiple sentences and words. Words are separated by spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "A single string with subsequent duplicate words removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints:\n",
    "The input string can be empty.\n",
    "The words are case-sensitive, meaning \"Word\" and \"word\" are considered different.\n",
